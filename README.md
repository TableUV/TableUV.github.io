# TableUV.github.io [WIP]
Website for our project.

### Acknowledgement 
The website is based on the template: https://github.com/CloudCannon/hydra-jekyll-template

## Develop

Hydra was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
