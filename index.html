				<h2>Improve your customers <strong>safety</strong> at the restaurant!</h2>
				<p> 
					Our Table UV Robot disinfects surfaces simply by moving above it. Using a unique mixture of UV-C light and alcohol vaporizers, 
					the Table UV Robot is able to kill up to 99.99% of common bacteria and viruses such as Campylobacter, E. Coli, Salmonella and SARS-CoV-2. 
					While the UV-C light is highly effective against many types of bacteria and diseases, Table UV is designed so that it is safe to people and gentle to surfaces.

				<h2>Smart cleaning that doesn't need your attention.</h2>
				<p>	
					Tabletops often have objects of different sizes and shapes that make it harder to clean. Our Table UV Robot is equipped with ToF SLAM solution with
					Obstacle Avoidance and Edge Detection Techology that allow the robot to autonomously navigate around the surface. Advanced Coverage Path Planning Algorithms 
					also make sure that the entire surface of the table is disinfected in the least amount of time.
