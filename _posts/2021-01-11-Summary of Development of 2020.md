#### Summary

The electrical team worked on the component selection, architecrture design, modelling &simulation, design calculation, and the schematic & layout design for the TableUV robot. By the end of the 2020, 7 custom PCBs designs were completed from scratch, and the gerber files were sent to be manufactured by PCBWay. 

Below are the 3D images of the PCB designs.

#### What's next?
The electrical team will be manufacturing the boards manually using hot plate and hand soldering once the compoenents and PCBs arrive. The boards will be tested on bench, and after any possible bugs/issues are solved, the firmware development will take in place.
