## Robot Assembly
After six-month developments, we have finally brought our robot to real-life from the design. As the picture shown below, it is surprisingly a tiny robot.

Despite its tiny size, it is super compact with all kinds of sensors and boards. As we may see the picture below, it is filled up with all instruments and layered densely.

From the bottom view, we can see three sets of IR sensors, 14 UV disinfectious leds, and differential wheel drive system.
